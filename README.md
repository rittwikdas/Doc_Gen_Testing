# Doc_Gen_Testing

# 🧪 Document Generator Test Repository

This repository is a **testing framework** for document generation applications that use structured prompts. It simulates a mock software/ML project and helps test end-to-end prompt filling, document building, and generation workflows.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This repository is built **for testing** a document generator system. It contains:

- Fake Python modules
- Dummy ML pipeline structure
- Artificially bloated `requirements.txt`
- A template covering **20 major software documentation sections**
- Tools to auto-generate a fake `generated_doc.md` file
